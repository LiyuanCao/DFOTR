# DFOTR

MATLAB and Python implementations of DFOTR algorithm from <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-006-0706-8">Bandeira, Afonso S., Katya Scheinberg, and Lu√≠s N. Vicente. "Computation of sparse low degree interpolating polynomials and their application to derivative-free optimization." Mathematical programming 134.1 (2012): 223-257.<a>

Use runMATLAB.m, runPython2.py, and runPython3.py to solve the demo problems. The Python3 version is up to date. The Matlab and Python2 versions are not being updated.
