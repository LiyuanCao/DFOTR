MATLAB and Python implementations of Algorithm 1 from <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-012-0578-z">Bandeira, Afonso S., Katya Scheinberg, and Lu√≠s N. Vicente. "Computation of sparse low degree interpolating polynomials and their application to derivative-free optimization." Mathematical programming 134.1 (2012): 223-257.<a> This is not the original implementation accompanying the paper, but a new one with slight improvement to the algorithm and much better coding. 

Use runMATLAB.m, runPython2.py, and runPython3.py to solve the demo problems. The Python3 version is up to date. The Matlab and Python2 versions are not being updated.
