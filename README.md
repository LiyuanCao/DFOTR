MATLAB and Python implementations of Algorithm 1 from <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-012-0578-z">Bandeira, Afonso S., Katya Scheinberg, and Lu√≠s N. Vicente. "Computation of sparse low degree interpolating polynomials and their application to derivative-free optimization." Mathematical programming 134.1 (2012): 223-257.<a> This is not the original implementation accompanying the paper, but a new one with small improvements to the algorithm and much better coding. 

Use runMATLAB.m, runPython2.py, and runPython3.py to solve the demo problems. The Matlab and Python3 versions are up to date. The Python2 version is not being updated. The Matlab_box_constraint contains an experimental version that uses infinity-norm trust region to handle box constraints. Please refer to compare.m to see two different ways to handle box constraints.
